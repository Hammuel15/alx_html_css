###🎧 Headphones Landing Page
Welcome to the Headphones Landing Page project — a fully functional, responsive webpage built from scratch using only HTML and CSS. This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and focuses on reinforcing foundational skills such as HTML structure, styling with CSS, responsive design, and accessibility — without using any external libraries or JavaScript (except in the final task).

#📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recreate a designer’s mockup (provided in Figma) as a responsive web page using semantic HTML and clean CSS. The page adapts seamlessly between desktop and mobile views and includes interactive elements using CSS only.

Designer Credit: This project is based on a design by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX Designer.
